# Type Interfaces

Type Interfaces describe different aspects of Types. At minimum, every Type must implement the `TypeInterface`. However, some types are more complex than others, and require more functionality, as described by the following interfaces.

1. `TypeInterface` - The base Type definition.
2. `InheritableTypeInterface` - Describes a Type than can inherit other Types.
3. `NameableTypeInterface` - Describes a Type with a name.
